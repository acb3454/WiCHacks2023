# Bloom
Bloom is a website dedicated to self care involving nature. The first four blocks involve a tasklist where users can input tasks related to self care and anything else they might need, and when they complete tasks by checking them off, they are rewarded with a small animation of the plant on the right. The plant can be interchanged with other types of plants by selecting them using the carousel at the bottom left, which also provides fun facts about the plants displayed. In the bottom right, there are preset tasks, like drinking a certain amount of water per day and going outside. When users select these, they are treated like completing tasks.
